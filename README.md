# Python-Hangman-Game
This is a Python script of the classic Hangman game.

 In this game, the word to guess is represented by a row of dashes. 
 If the player guess a letter which exists in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions.
  The player has specified number turns to guess the word.
  Here, one can easily customize the game by changing the variables.
